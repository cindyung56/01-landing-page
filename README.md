## Module 01 Mini Project - Landing Page
This mini project's goal was to create a landing page with the following criteria:

* It's done when the page uses semantic HTML elements.

* It's done when the page uses universal, element, and class selectors in CSS.

* It's done when the page features at least three colors in the design.

* It's done when the page uses a single font and font family for all text.

* It's done when the page uses at least two heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`).

* It's done when the header is fixed to the top of the page on scroll.

* It's done when the header contains a navigation bar with three links that display inline, including a contact link.

* It's done when, if the contact link is clicked, the page jumps directly to the contact form.

* It's done when the contact form includes `input` elements for name and email.

* It's done when the contact form includes a Send button.

* It's done when the image includes a descriptive `alt` attribute.

* It's done when the page is deployed to GitHub Pages.

## The Final Result

I took some liberties making this landing page with my knowledge of HTML and CSS. The result is this adorable landing page of the Final Fantasy mythical creature, the Carbuncle. Consider it as something similar to a shoutout to these cute and helpful creatures.
